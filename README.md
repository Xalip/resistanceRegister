# Resistance Register

# In the near future, rapid tests will be launched on the market to check whether someone has already produced antibodies against corona. our idea is to build a portal where private individuals can register who have already taken the rapid test. this way, the authorities will get an overview of the regions where resistance is already high and where it is even lower. theoretically, people who are resistant could be better employed as nursing staff.

# At first the idea is to build a responsive website to register yourself and scan your test id to proof that you are negative.
